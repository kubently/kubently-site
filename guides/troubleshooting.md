# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you diagnose and resolve common issues with Kubently deployments.

## Common Issues

### Executor Connection Problems

#### Executor Not Connecting to API

**Symptoms:**
- Executor logs show connection refused errors
- Commands don't reach the executor
- Cluster shows as unavailable in API

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check executor logs
kubectl logs -l app=kubently-executor -n kubently --tail=50

# Verify API service is running
kubectl get svc kubently-api -n kubently

# Test network connectivity from executor
kubectl exec -it deploy/kubently-executor -n kubently -- \
  curl -v http://kubently-api:8080/health
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Network Policy Issues**: Ensure network policies allow executorâ†’API communication
2. **Service Discovery**: Verify DNS resolution works within cluster
3. **API Service**: Check if API pods are running and healthy
4. **Firewall Rules**: For multi-cluster setups, check firewall rules
